Collaboration with Melania Berbatova

Our project contains 6 files. We got our best submission (accuracy of 0.76) running XGBoost. Files should be run in the following order: 

1. Cleaning.ipynb - cleaning of text

2. Features.ipynb - feature extraction for all 4 feature sets

3. CNN-RNN-with-Keras.ipynb - implementation of word embeddings with Glove and convolution and recurrent neural networks with Keras 

4. Random Forest Classifier.ipynb - ensemble learning method for classification

5. XGBoost Classifier.ipynb - Extreme Gradient Boosting (accuracy of 0.76)

6. XGBoost Parameter Tuning.ipynb - tuning the parameters max_depth, min_child_weight, and  gamma
